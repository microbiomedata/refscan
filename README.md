# refscan

`refscan` is a command-line tool people can use to scan the [NMDC](https://microbiomedata.org/) MongoDB database
for referential integrity violations.

## How it works

`refscan` does its job in two stages:
1. It uses the LinkML schema to determine where references _can_ exist in a MongoDB database that conforms to the schema.
   > **Example:** The schema might say that, if a document in the `biosample_set` collection has a field named
   > `associated_studies`, that field must contain a list of `id`s of documents in the `study_set` collection.
2. It scans the MongoDB database to check the integrity of all the references that _do_ exist.
   > **Example:** For each document in the `biosample_set` collection that _has_ a field named `associated_studies`,
   > for each value in that field, confirm there _is_ a document having that `id` in the `study_set` collection.

## Limitations

`refscan` was designed under the assumption that **every document** in **every collection described by the schema** has
a **field named `type`**, whose value is the [class_uri](https://linkml.io/linkml/code/metamodel.html#linkml_runtime.linkml_model.meta.ClassDefinition.class_uri) of the schema class the document represents an instance
of. `refscan` uses that `class_uri` value (in that `type` field) to determine the name of that schema class,
which it, in turn, uses to determine _which fields_ of that document can contain references.

## Usage

### Install

Assuming you have `pipx` installed, you can install the tool by running the following command:

```shell
pipx install refscan
```

> [`pipx`](https://pipx.pypa.io/stable/) is a tool people can use to
> [download and install](https://pipx.pypa.io/stable/#where-does-pipx-install-apps-from)
> Python scripts that are hosted on PyPI.
> You can [install `pipx`](https://pipx.pypa.io/stable/installation/) by running `$ python -m pip install pipx`.

### Run

You can display the tool's `--help` snippet by running:

```shell
refscan --help
```

At the time of this writing, the tool's `--help` snippet is:

> Note: The above snippet was captured from a terminal window whose width was 90 characters.

#### The MongoDB connection string (`--mongo-uri`)

As documented in the `--help` snippet above, you can provide the MongoDB connection string to the tool via either
(a) the `--mongo-uri` option; or (b) an environment variable named `MONGO_URI`. The latter can come in handy
when the MongoDB connection string contains information you don't want to appear in your shell history,
such as a password.

Here's how you could create that environment variable:

```shell  
export MONGO_URI='mongodb://username:password@localhost:27017'
```

#### The schema (`--schema`)

As documented in the `--help` snippet above, you can provide the path to a YAML-formatted LinkML schema file to the tool
via the `--schema` option.

Show/hide tips for getting a schema file
</summary>

---

If you have `curl` installed, you can download a YAML file from GitHub by running the following command (after replacing
the `{...}` placeholders and customizing the path):

```shell
# Download the raw content of https://github.com/{user_or_org}/{repo}/blob/{branch}/path/to/schema.yaml
curl -o schema.yaml https://raw.githubusercontent.com/{user_or_org}/{repo}/{branch}/path/to/schema.yaml
```

For example:

```shell
# Download the raw content of https://github.com/microbiomedata/berkeley-schema-fy24/blob/main/nmdc_schema/nmdc_materialized_patterns.yaml
curl -o schema.yaml https://raw.githubusercontent.com/microbiomedata/berkeley-schema-fy24/main/nmdc_schema/nmdc_materialized_patterns.yaml
```

---
</details>

#### Output

While `refscan` is running, it will display console output indicating what it's currently doing.

![Screenshot of refscan console output](./docs/refscan-screenshot.png)

Once the scan is complete, the reference report (TSV file) and violation report (TSV file) will be available
in the current directory (or in custom directories, if any were specified via CLI options).

### Update

You can update the tool to [the latest version available on PyPI](https://pypi.org/project/refscan/) by running:

```shell
pipx upgrade refscan
```

### Uninstall

You can uninstall the tool from your computer by running:

```shell
pipx uninstall refscan
```

## Development

We use [Poetry](https://python-poetry.org/) to both (a) manage dependencies and (b) build distributable packages that can be published to PyPI.

- `pyproject.toml`: Configuration file for Poetry and other tools (was initialized via `$ poetry init`)
- `poetry.lock`: List of dependencies, both direct and [indirect/transitive](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transitive_dependency)

### Clone repository

```shell
git clone https://github.com/microbiomedata/refscan.git
cd refscan
```

### Create virtual environment

Create a Poetry virtual environment and attach to its shell:

```shell
poetry shell
```

> You can see information about the Poetry virtual environment by running: `$ poetry env info`

> You can detach from the Poetry virtual environment's shell by running: `$ exit`

From now on, I'll refer to the Poetry virtual environment's shell as the "Poetry shell."

### Install dependencies

At the Poetry shell, install the project's dependencies:

```shell
poetry install
```

### Make changes

Edit the tool's source code and documentation however you want.

While editing the tool's source code, you can run the tool as you normally would in order to test things out.

```shell
refscan --help
```

### Run tests

We use [pytest](https://docs.pytest.org/en/8.2.x/) as the testing framework for `refscan`.

Tests are defined in the `tests` directory.

You can run the tests by running the following command from the root directory of the repository:

```shell
poetry run pytest
```

### Format code

We use [`black`](https://black.readthedocs.io/en/stable/) as the code formatter for `refscan`. 

We do not use it with its default options. Instead, we include an option that allows lines to be 120 characters
instead of the default 88 characters. That option is defined in the `[tool.black]` section of `pyproject.toml`.

You can format all the Python code in the repository by running this command
from the root directory of the repository:

```shell
poetry run black .
```

#### Check format

You can _check_ the format of the Python code by including the `--check` option, like this:

```shell
poetry run black --check .
```

## Building and publishing

### Build for production

Whenever someone publishes a [GitHub Release](https://github.com/microbiomedata/refscan/releases) in this repository,
a [GitHub Actions workflow](.github/workflows/build-and-publish-package-to-pypi.yml)
will automatically build a package and publish it to [PyPI](https://pypi.org/project/refscan/).
That package will have a version identifier that matches the name of the Git tag associated with the Release.

### Test the build process locally

In case you want to test the build process locally, you can do so by running:

```shell
poetry build
```

> That will create both a
> [source distribution](https://setuptools.pypa.io/en/latest/deprecated/distutils/sourcedist.html#creating-a-source-distribution)
> file (whose name ends with `.tar.gz`) and a
> [wheel](https://packaging.python.org/en/latest/specifications/binary-distribution-format/#binary-distribution-format)
> file (whose name ends with `.whl`) in the `dist` directory.

## Appendix

### refgraph

When `pipx` installs `refscan`, it also installs a program called `refgraph`. `refgraph` is a program you can use to
generate a web-based, interactive graph (network diagram) of the relationships that can exist between documents in a
database that conforms to a given schema. It can present the relationships in terms of either database collections
or schema classes.

You can learn more about `refgraph` by running:

```shell
refgraph --help
```

> Note: `refgraph` is still in early development and its features and CLI are subject to change.
